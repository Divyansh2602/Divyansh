            <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">Air pollution mostly occurs in industrial towns in India and abroad. While technological developments and industrialization have led to creation of wealth and prosperity, it has also caused a massive pollution of the environment. The harmful burning of fuels such as coal and petroleum in some major industries like automobile, electrical power plants, etc., cause air pollution. Smoke emitted from factories and houses pollute the atmosphere. Excessive smoke and fumes have a very bad effect on plants, animals and human beings.


                
                
                 
                About 50 per cent of the air pollution is primarily due to the rapid industrialization that has taken place in the 20th century. Automobiles greatly pollute the atmosphere. Fumes from different types of motor vehicles cause respiratory diseases like asthma and bronchitis.
                
                The problem caused by air pollution is worldwide. It contaminates the atmosphere, damages buildings and historical monuments, harms the health of the people, and causes respiratory diseases and increases gases like carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.
                
                Nuclear plants are also a major threat. There is the risk of radioactive leaks. Nuclear tests also pollute the air and lead to the warming of the earthâ€™s atmosphere. The melting of ice-caps at the poles is causing a rise in the sea level and flooding.</p>
